-need to have async and non-async functions for each action (where reasonable)
-need to have cli and gui friendly versions or flags (where reasonable)
-each library needs a list of the actions that they perform
-each library should not have using statements for system libraries
    (I don't know why that's a benefit but it sounds like a good idea)
